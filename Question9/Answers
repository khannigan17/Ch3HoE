I found the W3C validator incredibly easy to use, and I wasn't really surprised by it as we've gone over it before. I only encountered a few errors, all of which were mostly silly typos and it was incredibly easy to fix them. I would definately reccommend it to other students as it's quick and might save them a letter grade.
